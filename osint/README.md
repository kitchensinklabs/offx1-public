### [Signal, QR Codes, and Nation-State Threats: Analyzing the Pentagon’s Recent OPSEC Bulletin](./20250325-OffByOne-Signal_OPSEC_Threat_Report_Draft.pdf)

> **Date**: 25 March 2025<br/>

> **Type**: Threat Intelligence Report<br/>
> **Focus**: Secure Messaging, Mobile Security, APT Attribution<br/>

In March 2025, a leaked Pentagon OPSEC bulletin revealed the possible exploitation of Signal Messenger’s “linked device” feature by Russian APT actors. Our analysis explores:

- Whether the attack represents sophisticated phishing or an undisclosed zero-day
- How QR code-based session linking can become an attack surface
- The implications for government use, journalists, activists, and secure comms developers
- Recommendations to mitigate risks even in the absence of a disclosed vulnerability

We conclude that this is likely **not a simple phishing campaign**, but a **nation-state-level operation targeting the integrity of secure communications platforms**.
